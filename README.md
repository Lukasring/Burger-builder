## Burger Builder App

A demo SPA project for building and ordering a burger. Made with **React** *(create-react-app)*.
User can add ingredients to a burger and proceed to checkout to order it. For that he needs to make an account or log in, then his order is made.

**You can check it out [HERE]("https://lukasring.github.io/Burger-builder/")**

Uses *react-router* for routing and *REDUX* for state managment. 
*Firebase* was used as backend. User sign up and verification with tokens. **This functionality no longer exists as I deleted the firebase endpoint.**
